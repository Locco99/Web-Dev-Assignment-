# Web-Dev-Assignment-
This is a group assignment for web development which I solely did it. I had no collaborators for this assignment.

Group Assignment â€“ Solution Approach
This project is a responsive personal portfolio website designed to showcase an individual's skills, services, and portfolio work. The solution is implemented using standard web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design is modern, visually appealing, and mobile-friendly, ensuring a good user experience across devices.
Structure
index.html: The main HTML file structures the content into sections such as Header, Hero, About, Services, Skills, Portfolio, and Footer. Semantic HTML5 elements and class names are used for clarity and maintainability.
style.css: This file contains all the custom styles, including layout, typography, color schemes, and responsive design. Media queries ensure the site adapts to different screen sizes.
script.js: JavaScript is used to add interactivity, such as:
Typing animation in the hero section.
Responsive navigation menu toggle for mobile devices.
Scroll-to-top button functionality.
Key Features
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices using CSS Flexbox and media queries.
Modern UI/UX: Clean typography, color palette, and spacing for a professional look.
Interactive Elements: Typing effect, animated progress bars, and smooth navigation.
Accessibility: Uses semantic HTML and accessible navigation patterns.
Easy Customization: The code is organized and commented for easy updates and personalization.

How It Works
Header & Navigation: Sticky header with a brand logo, navigation links, and a theme switcher.
Hero Section: Animated typing effect introduces the portfolio owner and their roles.
About & Services: Sections to describe the individual, their biography, and services offered.
Skills: Visual progress bars to highlight key skills.
Portfolio: Grid layout to showcase work samples with hover effects.
Footer: Contact information and social media links.
JavaScript Enhancements: Adds dynamic effects and improves user interaction.
